- get familiar with code in this repository (rl_reading folder)
- extend agent/decoder such that it can predict several characters after
  each encoding step.
	- add a "stop" action
	- implement in the decoder that it stops decoding only once the stop action occurs
	- change input patch size and patch-movement such that the agent is forced to predict multiple
	  characters after each encoding step
